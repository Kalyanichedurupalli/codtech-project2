OBJECTIVES:

Build and train a model to accurately classify sentiment in movie reviews.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Deploy the model to predict sentiment on new, unseen movie reviews.

KEY ACTIVITIES:

DATA COLLECTION: Gather IMDb Movie Reviews dataset or a similar dataset containing labeled movie reviews.
DATA PREPROCESSING: Clean and preprocess text data, including tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorizing text.
MODEL TRAINING: Implement machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
MODEL EVALUATION: Assess model performance using classification metrics on a held-out test dataset.
MODEL DEPLOYMENT: Deploy the trained model to predict sentiment in real-time on new movie reviews.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

PYTHON: Programming language for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
PANDAS AND NUMPY: Data manipulation and numerical computing libraries.
SCIKIT-LEARN: Machine learning library for implementing classification algorithms and evaluating model performance.
TENSORFLOW OR PYTORCH: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural network models.
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES: Tokenization, stopwords removal, and vectorization for text preprocessing.
